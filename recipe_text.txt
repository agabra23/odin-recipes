Ribeye

Ingredients:
- 1 Ribeye Steak (USDA Prime)
- Salt
- Olive or Avocado Oil
- Butter
- 3 Cloves of Garlic
- Aromatics (Sprigs of Rosemary, Thyme, etc.)


Instructions:
1. Drizzle about 2 tbsp of your oil into a cast-iron (non-stick will do if that's all
you have) pan.
2. Heat the pan on medium heat until very hot.
3. While the pan is heating, sprinkle a nice layer of salt on both sides of the raw
steak.
4. Once the pan is hot, place your steak flat onto the pan and make sure you hear
a sizzle.
5. Without moving the steak around, let it sear on one side for about 3 minutes.
6. Flip the steak and toss in your clumps of butter, garlic cloves (crushed), and
your aromatics of choice.
7. Begin to baste the steak with the puddle of melted butter and otehr ingredients
you just added (for about 20 seconds or so).
8. Now, let that side of the steak finish searing for about 2 minutes.
9. Remove the garlic and aromatics from the pan. Move the steak onto a plate and let
it rest for about 5 minutes.
10. Drizzle the leftover butter-juice mixture from the pan onto the steak,
slice, and enjoy!
