    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Ribeye Steak (USDA Prime)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive or Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Aromatics (Sprigs of Rosemary, Thyme, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drizzle about 2 tbsp of your oil into a cast-iron (non-stick will do if that's all
            you have) pan.</li>
        <li>Heat the pan on medium heat until very hot.</li>
        <li>While the pan is heating, sprinkle a nice layer of salt on both sides of the raw
            steak.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, place your steak flat onto the pan and make sure you hear
            a sizzle.</li>
        <li>Without moving the steak around, let it sear on one side for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the steak and toss in your clumps of butter, garlic cloves (crushed), and
            your aromatics of choice.</li>
        <li>Begin to baste the steak with the puddle of melted butter and other ingredients
            you just added (for about 20 seconds or so).</li>
        <li>Now, let that side of the steak finish searing for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic and aromatics from the pan. Move the steak onto a plate and let
            it rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the leftover butter-juice mixture from the pan onto the steak,
            slice, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
