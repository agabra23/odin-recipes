# odin-recipes

This is my first official coding project studying full-stack web development. I will
only be using html and css in this project.

This project is a recipe website that has a few cool recipes available to access from a homepage. This project gets me to practice the basics of html including boilerplate code, relative and absolute links, images, lists, and proper file structure.
